I am a PhD researcher with a strong academic background and solid quantitative research skills.

My research interests lie in economics and finance, with a particular focus on data-driven analysis and empirical methods.

I am highly self-motivated, detail-oriented, and experienced in independent research as well as collaborative academic work.
