The escalating imperative to mitigate global warming has positioned urban areas at the forefront of decarbonisation efforts, given their disproportionate contribution to greenhouse gas emissions and their potential as hubs for innovative energy transitions. As outlined in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) special report on global warming of 1.5C (IPCC, 2018), limiting temperature rises to this threshold necessitates profound transformations in energy systems, land use, and urban infrastructure worldwide. Cities, accounting for over 70% of global carbon dioxide emissions, embody both the challenges and opportunities inherent in this shift.

In this context, carbon markets encompassing emissions trading schemes and related pricing mechanisms emerge as pivotal instruments for incentivising low-carbon pathways. Yet, the efficacy of these markets in facilitating urban energy transitions remains underexplored, particularly when viewed through the lens of city typologies.

This systematic literature review (SLR) synthesises extant research on how carbon markets influence decarbonisation trajectories across varied urban typologies, illuminating tailored pathways towards sustainable energy futures.

## Rationale for City Typologies

The classification into four typologies port, resource, manufacturing, and service draws from established frameworks in economic geography and urban studies (Burgess, 1925; Castells, 1989; Sassen, 2013). These categories align with recent analyses of energy regions and encapsulate the bulk of urban emission profiles while maintaining focus on dense urban settings relevant to carbon market applications.

## Urban Energy Transitions and Typological Differences

Urban energy transitions intertwine technological innovation, policy frameworks, and socio-economic dynamics. Resource-based cities often grapple with fossil fuel legacies, while megacity clusters exhibit opportunities for low-carbon industrial shifts. Ports face challenges in renewable integration, and European contexts highlight the need for sufficiency-based approaches.

## Carbon Markets in Urban Contexts

Carbon markets theoretically drive efficiency and innovation, but outcomes vary by typology. Studies reveal heterogeneous effects, spatial spillovers, and the need for tailored pricing strategies across different urban forms.

## Research Gaps and Methodology

Despite extensive literature on carbon emissions, few syntheses address typological modulation of carbon market efficacy. This review employs a comprehensive search strategy and narrative synthesis (Popay et al., 2006) adhering to PRISMA guidelines (Moher et al., 2009).

## Objectives

- Assess differential effects of carbon markets on diverse urban typologies.
- Map evolving trends and uncover research voids.
- Scrutinise how typologies modulate carbon market dynamics.
- Formulate policy recommendations and future research agendas for equitable, typology-tailored transitions.

## Key Insights and Recommendations

Trends indicate quantitative dominance in the literature, with persistent gaps in voluntary markets and just transitions. Policy should tailor interventions to typologies. Future research should prioritise interdisciplinary models and Global South contexts.

This SLR contributes a nuanced understanding of carbon markets as enablers of urban energy transitions, fostering equitable decarbonisation across diverse cityscapes.
